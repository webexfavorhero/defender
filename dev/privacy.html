            <p>We take no responsibility for stored information in your cache, or in other devices that may store information, and disclaim all liability of such.  In addition, we may, from time to time, retain residual information about you in our backup and/or database.</p>

          <li>
            <h2>Third Party Websites</h2>
            <p>TrafficDefender may post links to third party websites on its Site or in its App.  These third party websites are not screened for privacy or security issues by TrafficDefender, and you release us from any liability for the conduct of these third party websites.</p>
            <p>Please be aware that this Privacy Policy, and any other policies in place, in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to members of the Service or Site.

            <h2>Third Party Access to Your Information</h2>
            <p>Although you are entering into an Agreement with TrafficDefender to disclose your information to us, we do use third party individuals and organizations to assist us, including contractors, web hosts, and others.</p>
            <p>Throughout the course of our provision of our Service to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information.  For example, our web host stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire outside contractors to perform maintenance or assist us in securing our website.</p>
            <p>It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Privacy Policy.  For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or systems.  You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.</p>

          <li>
            <h2>Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes</h2>
            <p>At times it may become necessary or desirable to TrafficDefender, for legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request from a government agency or a private litigant.  You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter.  In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either.  We may also proactively report you, and release your information to, third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities.</p>
            <p>You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.</p>
